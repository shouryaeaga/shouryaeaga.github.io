Hi, I'm Shourya Eaga, a Year 12 student passionate about Computer Science and Mathematics. This blog was created to share beautiful and interesting ideas in the fields of Mathematics and Computer Science, the subjects that interest me the most. It serves as a playground for learning new topics and eventually share them by putting my own spin on them through interactive segments which hope to explain topics clearer and in a more interesting way.
